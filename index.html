      </br>
      <big>The first solo concert of Kairat Nurtas took place on the day of his coming of age in Almaty in 2008. It was
        held in the Palace of the Republic. It is noteworthy that an hour before the performance, the hall was only half
        full. But a few minutes before the start, there was not a single empty seat in it – all tickets were sold out.
        So the stellar biography of Kairat Nurtas started from the first full house. Since then, the mega-popular singer
        in Kazakhstan has started a tradition – to give a big solo concert on every regular birthday.</big>
      </br>
      <big>With equal success, Kairat Nurtas performs songs by young little-known composers and hits of Kazakh pop
        classics - Asset Beiseuov, Shamshi Kaldayakov and others. For a long time, Kairat sang in a duet with the famous
        pop singer Syrym Isabayev, together with whom he performed the song "Merging of Hearts", which became a
        hit.</big>
      </br>
      </br>
      <big>The career of Kairat Nurtas that began turned out to be extremely rapid. Now the artist's repertoire includes
        more than a hundred songs and dozens of CDs. The absolute advantage of the Kazakh singer is the live performance
        of author's songs at concerts. It is noteworthy that Kairat Nurtas is loved by young fans of talent and the
        older generation. The hits "Kaida Kaida" and "Baralmadym" were included in the list of the best songs of
        Kazakhstan.</big>

    </br>
    <big class="margin">The fit singer with a charming smile, whose height is 171 cm and weight does not exceed 65 kg,
      has a large army of fans who have always been interested in the personal life of the idol. But Kairat Nurtas was
      extremely reluctant to talk about this topic, arousing even greater interest in his own person.</big>
    </br>
    <big class="margin">Kairat Nurtas' hobby is horse riding. For the sake of passion, the singer acquired several
      thoroughbred horses. Often jockey photos appear on the artist's Instagram. And he also assembled an impressive
      fleet of vehicles, where, in addition to sports cars, there are also rare models on which Nurtas likes to ride
      around the city. The musician does not forget about his relatives. Gulzira Aidarbekova's mother, who is his
      producer, was presented with a Lexus RX crossover by the singer. The license plate of the SUV turned out to be
      difficult - 777gul.</big>
    </br>
    </br>
    <big class="margin">Interestingly, Nurtas hid his family from the public for 10 years, even with his wife Kairat
      tried not to appear in public places, but in 2018 he presented joint photos of his wife and children to the
      delight of fans.

      Kairat is scrupulous about the appearance of his wife, not even allowing her to appear on the beach in open
      swimsuits, and in public - in transparent outfits. At all events, Zhuldyz is present in elegant floor-length
      dresses.</big>
